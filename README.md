#ext-to-ASL: ASL Translation Web App

Text-to-ASL is a web application designed to translate text and speech into American Sign Language (ASL) gestures. This tool helps bridge communication gaps for individuals with hearing impairments by providing visual representations of ASL signs. It enables real-time translation of written or spoken input into animated ASL signs, making communication more accessible and inclusive. This project aims to empower both hearing and non-hearing users by facilitating easier interactions through a digital interface.
